# type casting
# this typecasting is explicit where we instruct the variable datatype through coding
a ="1"
b ="2"
print(int(a)+int(b))
# now we discuss what is th typecasting priority for variables
# float variable have higher priority that integer in python
# implicit typecasting actually means python will convert the variable datatype automatically
# just like under this line
c =1.9
d= 9
print(c+d)
