# string length
name ="Sparsh"
print(len(name))
# string slicing
print(name[0:2])
# in the above line of print we are asking python to prints letters
# with their unique address assign by python
# the letter from id 0,1,2
# in the string name contains sparsh
# unique id for every letter is 
# s=0 p=1 a=2 r=3 s=4 h=5
# in every programming language letters have unique id starts from 0 
# now we start  -ve slicing
print(name[-4:-2])
# in this we need to use formula for -ve string slicing
# formula will be add number of letters with the negative string number given by the question
# and you will get the answer
# now we learnt so far so goodbye
